WowMania is a web platform where players of World of Warcraft can buy and sell services and in-game items. Users can create listings for items or services they offer, and buyers can browse and purchase services. The services will officially take place in game and our website will serve as an easier, more convinient way to connect gamers. There are going to be 2 types of users: Buyer and Seller. Additionally, the platform includes a Looking for Group system, allowing players to find teammates for dungeons and raids, despite their website user types. 

Key Features:
 - User System: Registration, login, and role-based access (regular users & admins).
 - Marketplace: Players can list items or services for sale and browse available offers.
 - Looking for Group (LFG) System: Users can post requests for dungeon and raid groups.
