WowMania is a web platform where players of World of Warcraft can buy and sell services and in-game items. Users can create listings for items or services they offer, and buyers can browse and purchase services. The services will officially take place in game and our website will serve as an easier, more convinient way to connect gamers. There are going to be 2 types of users: Buyer and Seller. Additionally, the platform includes a Looking for Group system, allowing players to find teammates for dungeons and raids, despite their website user types. 

Key Features:
 - User System: Registration, login, and role-based access (regular users & admins).
 - Marketplace: Players can list items or services for sale and browse available offers.
 - Looking for Group (LFG) System: Users can post requests for dungeon and raid groups.

Task 1 - Interview

User 1: David 

Q: What are your main goals when using a platform like WowMania?
To find reliable sellers for raid and mount boosts without wasting time in trade chat. I also want to offer Mythic+ carries and coaching to earn gold or real money.

Q: What challenges or frustrations do you currently face?
It’s hard to trust people in-game. I’ve been scammed before and trade chat is disorganized. There’s no proper reputation system or way to check if someone’s legit.

Q: What would make you feel safer when buying/selling services?
Having verified profiles, a review/rating system, and secure payments managed by the site would give me confidence.

Q: What kind of services or items would you look for or offer?
I’d buy raid carries, PvP boosts, and rare transmogs. I’d sell Mythic+ runs, crafting, and possibly 1-on-1 coaching.

Q: How do you find groups for content now, and would you use LFG?
I use the in-game group finder but it’s limited. If your LFG has better filters and shows player experience, I’d definitely use it.

Q: How often do you play and use similar platforms?
I play 4–5 times a week. I’d use the platform regularly to check for offers or manage orders.

Q: What devices do you use to access WoW-related platforms?
Mainly my PC, but I check on mobile when I’m away.

Q: What kind of user experience would you expect?
A clean, responsive UI with a WoW feel, but not cluttered. Fast search and filtering options are a must.


User 2: Sorana

Q: What are your main goals when using a platform like WowMania?
To buy mounts, pets, and cosmetics that I can’t get easily on my own, and occasionally ask for help with achievements or dungeons.

Q: What challenges or frustrations do you currently face?
The auction house is overwhelming and trade chat feels unsafe. I’ve had bad experiences with impatient or rude players.

Q: What would make you feel safer?
Ratings, reviews, and a friendly, visual platform. I’d feel better if payments were handled by the site.

Q: What kind of services or items would you look for or offer?
I’d look for cosmetics and easy-going dungeon runs. I might offer crafting if it's simple to set up.

Q: How do you find groups now? Would you use an LFG system?
I avoid pugging when I can. A filtered LFG that matches my pace and playstyle would be great.

Q: How often do you play and how would you use the platform?
I play 2–3 times a week and would check the site occasionally when I need something.

Q: What devices do you use?
Mostly mobile, sometimes a tablet or laptop.

Q: What kind of experience do you expect?
Something easy to use, mobile-friendly, with visuals and a welcoming tone.

User 3: Alex

Q: What are your main goals when using a platform like WowMania?
To offer tanking services, meet new players, and run organized groups. Maybe earn some gold on the side.

Q: What challenges or frustrations do you currently face?
In-game LFG is unreliable and full of toxic or inexperienced players. Hard to find like-minded people.

Q: What would make you feel safer or more confident?
Player profiles with reviews and role tags. Scheduling options and online status indicators would help a lot.

Q: What kind of services or items would you look for or offer?
I’d mostly offer my time as a tank for Mythic+ or raids. I’d buy occasional gear boosts or PvP help.

Q: How do you find groups now, and would you switch to a new LFG?
I use in-game tools, but they’re hit-or-miss. I’d switch to a more social, filtered system right away.

Q: How often do you play and would you use the platform?
I play 3–4 times a week. I’d check the platform regularly when I’m available to group up.

Q: What devices do you use?
Mostly PC, but I’d use my phone to manage listings or check requests.



Q: What kind of user experience do you expect?
Simple, clear, with LFG boards, roles, and the ability to schedule or filter by behavior and goals.
